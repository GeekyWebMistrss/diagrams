# Git for Teams - Diagrams

This repository contains the source files for the diagrams I have used in my books, workshops, and sessions on Git. You are welcome to use these diagrams in your own materials, and build on them so long as you provide credit.

"By design" limitations are as follows:

- _/book-svg_ - Black and white vector illustrations; intended for print.
- File names often refer to the chapter where the illustration appeared in the first edition of Git for Teams. These file names may change over time.

You should not feel restricted by these limitations and should make your own adaptations to fit the context where you will be using the diagrams. I gladly accept suggestions for improvement.

The "people" used in the diagrams are available under a CC-0 license in a [separate repository](https://github.com/gitforteams/people).
